NOTE: login system is low priority, would be useful for saving data (possibly 
SQL, JSON, or CSV) and leaderboard

NOTE: stretch goal, have AI take over if player disconnects
NOTE: stretch goal, ingame chat, EMOTES???

NOTE: if we need unique names and pfp on board, can remove pfp from login, 
have screen to select "display name" (different from username) and pfp

QUESTION: should we have user select username and profile picture after both are
connected to make sure username and pfp are unique?
