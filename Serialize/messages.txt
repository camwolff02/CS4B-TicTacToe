NOTE: login system is low priority, would be useful for saving data (possibly 
SQL, JSON, or CSV) and leaderboard

NOTE: stretch goal, have AI take over if player disconnects
NOTE: stretch goal, ingame chat, EMOTES???

NOTE: if we need unique names and pfp on board, can remove pfp from login, 
have screen to select "display name" (different from username) and pfp

QUESTION: should we have user select username and profile picture after both are
connected to make sure username and pfp are unique?



MESSAGES
CreateLogin = username, password, profile picure
AddProfilePic = profile picture (used if user uploads custom pfp)
ClientInfo = username, profile picture
Login = username, password
CreateGame = Lobby Name
JoinGame = Lobby Name
MakeMove = move position
ListGames = <empty>
ListOfGames = [lobby names of non-full games]
ActionSuccess = True or False 
StartGame = <empty>
ClientDisconnected = <empty>
GameOver = Win, Lose, Tie
PlayAgain = True or False
Exit = <empty>



NOTE: DON'T have a generic action success for every message response
- have a base class for request and for response
- maybe break up message into chunks, like so:
    | message type | client sending/receiving | data | etc. |
